### Added
- experimental round trip functionality
  - round trips can be made from one starting point by choosing the
    approximate length (`options.round_trip.length`) of the trip (may vary greatly!)
  - the roundness sets the `options.round_trip.points` api parameter
    and defines the number of helper points generated
  - the randomization sets the `options.round_trip.seed` api parameter
    which randomly defines the direction in which the helper points
    are generated

### Fixed
- gpx export with ors API ([#308](https://github.com/GIScience/openrouteservice-app/issues/308))
